Problem 2:

- Used LDA and GM with 10 components. 
- Plotted a histogram of yhat. Labels appear to be distributed as sample 
- For CountVectorizer; max_df=0.95, min_df=2, max_features=1000
- homogeneity, completeness, v_measure_score: 2.43221462151737, 1.6831935223779175, 1.9895416215490973
- Put the thing in a function and looped it for different K and T values. Plotted the heat map to visually inspect the relationship between the scores and K and T.
- It appears that: 1) homogeneity is minimized by minimizing t and maximizing k, 2) completeness is minimized by minimizing t and minimizing k 3) v_measure is minimized by minimizing t and minimizing k. The optimal value, therefore, is decided as T  = 4 and K = 40
- Based on the plot, I chose T as 4 and K as 30.
- Printed the topics for LDA.
